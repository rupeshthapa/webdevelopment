<h1>MY PORTFOLIO</body></h1>
<br>
<p>By: Rupesh Thapa| Student</p>

<p>Date:</p>
	<p>This is an assignment provided by University of Northampton via Nami College to every individual students of Bsc Computing. It was given in 11 may 2021. Objective of this assignment was to check whether students are capable or not to create a webpage using HTML and CSS also to managr code using Git/GitHub.</p>
	<br>
	 <p>To be honest this assignment was a headache but after starting, it was very fun. It helped to learn so many things related to coding. There was a little bit struggle to start and so much scuffle to search proper way to do. And after beginning, whenever coding process did not go smoothly as hoped it used to be so mundane but when it went in a flow and everything was accurate it makes feel so cheerful and built a desire to do more. First of all, the lecutre and tutorail which were taught and done in the college helped alot and besides that some of the websites and online tutorial gave some tips to complete this assignment. </p>
	 <br>
	 <p>Module tutor (Mr. Thapa) used to provide slides of a lecture which became very beneficial. Without that slides it was almost impossible to design this webpage. While having discussion on the topic, "how to do?" about placeholder images it was difficult to understand but Mr. Thapa shared his knowledge showing his patience. </p>
