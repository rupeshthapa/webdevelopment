			<br> <br>
			<p>This is an assignment provided by University of Northampton via Nami College to every individual students of Bsc Computing. It was given in 11 may 2021A.D. Objective of this assignment was to check whether students are capable or not to create a webpage using HTML and CSS along with managing code using Git/GitHub.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To be honest, this assignment was a headache but after starting, it was very fun. It helped to learn so many things related to coding. There was a little bit struggle to start and so much scuffle to search proper way to do it. And after it was started, whenever coding process was not going smoothly as hoped, it used to be so mundane but when it went in a flow and everything was accurate it makes feel so cheerful and built a desire to do more. </p>
			<br>
			<p>First of all, the lecutre and the tutorail which were taught and done in the college helped alot and besides that some of the websites and online tutorial gave some tips to complete this assignment. Module tutor (Mr. Thapa) used to provide slides of a lecture which was very beneficial. Without that slides it was almost impossible to design this webpage. While having discussion on the topic, "how to do?" it was difficult to understand about placeholder images but Mr. Thapa shared his knowledge so smoothly showing his patience. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Here are some of the explanations of designs, fonts, colors and links which were used to make this webpage:</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Navigation Bar:</h4>
			<p>Like, for every websites navigation bar is mandatory and here is also navigation bar avialable to visit different pages(Home, Portfolio, Contact, CV, Sitereport).  And the bars are in black color having equal font sizes  along with active class and hover. In this part, background color looks like skyblue color i.e. '#00a3cc' color code and makes attractive and heading style which is Portfolio of left hand side was choosen from online tutorial.</p>

				<h4>Hamburger Icon with Responsive Menu along with Media queries:</h4>
				<p>This was the most difficult part. There was so much struggle to do it. It was like breaking hills. Looked several videos, sites but still was not able to find proper way to do it. At last, one of the friend suggested one video which was too good to do it. To create the icon there was a code was not written on own.</p>

				<br> <br>
				<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
				<p>While making this webpage, every kind of emotions was involved. Font sizes and colors were choosen by checking many times and it was difficult to create this webpage by following the process which was given. If there was not so much restrictions, maybe it would be easier. Anyway, it was fun plus helped to learn so many things and told coding is not easy like thought. We have to labour hard to be professional.</p>
