	<p>This is an assignment provided by University of Northampton via Nami College to every individual students of Bsc Computing. It was given in 11 may 2021A.D. Objective of this assignment was to check whether students are capable or not to create a webpage using HTML and CSS also to manage code using Git/GitHub.</p>
	<br>
	 <p>To be honest, this assignment was a headache but after starting, it was very fun. It helped to learn so many things related to coding. There was a little bit struggle to start and so much scuffle to search proper way to do. And after beginning, whenever coding process did not go smoothly as hoped it used to be so mundane but when it went in a flow and everything was accurate it makes feel so cheerful and built a desire to do more. First of all, the lecutre and the tutorail which were taught and done in the college helped alot and besides that some of the websites and online tutorial gave some tips to complete this assignment. </p>
	 <br>
	 <p>Module tutor (Mr. Thapa) used to provide slides of a lecture which was very beneficial. Without that slides it was almost impossible to design this webpage. While having discussion on the topic, "how to do?" it was difficult to understand about placeholder images but Mr. Thapa shared his knowledge showing his patience. </p>
	 <br>
	 <p>Here are some of the explanations of designs, fonts, colors and links which were used to make webpage:</p>
	 <br>
	 <p>[In this webpage, every colors are choosen which were suitable according to their parts for designing through 'w3schools' which is a popular website launched in the purpose of providing knowledge related to coding.]</p>
	 <br> <br>
	 <h4>Navigation Bar:</h4>
	 <p>Like, for every websites navigation bar is mandatory and here is also navigation bar avilable to visit different pages(Home, Portfolio, Contact, CV, Sitereport). In this part, background color looks like skyblue color i.e. '#00a3cc' color code and makes attractive. Heading is Portfoliio of left hand side which have a little animation (turns into white in after refreshing and visting every pages). And the bars are in black color having font size  along with active class and hover(color code).<br> [This navigation part was learned from 'Coding Nepal' which is online tutorial.]</p>
	 <br> <br>
	 <h4>Home Page:</h4>
	 <p>This page welcomes a visitor and tells a little bio along with tagline, lightgray background color and black text color.</p>
	 <br> <br>
	 <h4>Portfolio:</h4>
	 <p>In this page, there are all placeholder images with various width and height and can be replaced in term 2. Images are taken from the 'placeholder.com'.
	 	Whole background color is in lightgray and placeholder images background color is in darkgray.
	 </p>
	 <br> <br>
	 <h4>Contact:</h4>
	 <p>This page also contains lightgray background with contact details and a form which launch email program in a box of soft black background color(rgb(0,0,0,0.8)) with a box shadow. </p>
	 <br> <br>
	 <h4>CV:</h4>
	 <p>There is also background color lightgray and contains curriculum vitae of till now with different sections and explanations in a column inside white background color(#fff).</p>
	 <br>

	 <p>[These colors were decided because these were looking beautiful according to the layout of a website.]</p>
